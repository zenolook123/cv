    <p>Unfortunately this portion of the document is going to be the <strong>least impressive... I hope.</strong> <br>
      I went to school in the Edina school district, completing my highest
      education with a diploma from Edina Highschool. I went to Normandale Community College for about a year as I didn't know what I wanted to major in and this is one
      of the biggest regrets I have in life. I've always been worried that in the professional world I would never be taken seriously given my lack of a 4 year degree or similar. Unfortunately with
      my current position in life I don't have the finances to afford full time school for 4 years and balance that with owning a house. With Prime Academy under my belt I'm hoping to open doors
      to jobs and positions I would have never thought possible in the past and get a fresh start and outlook on life. </p>
